Researchers asked young adults to rate how much various pop hits made them want to tap, move, or dance, as well as how nostalgic and familiar the songs felt.\n\nWhile both nostalgia and familiarity boosted enjoyment and movement, only nostalgia predicted the urge to dance. The findings suggest that emotionally charged memories may be key to unlocking our gr...",
